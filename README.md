# Multi-Agent Systems: Collaborative AI Workflows

Multi-agent systems enable specialized AI agents to collaborate on complex tasks, offering a transparent, modular alternative to opaque large language models. This repository introduces these systems through practical examples, starting with a simple content creation workflow. Designed for students and developers, it showcases how agent-based architectures simplify AI development.

The repository contains multiple folders, with `crew_ai_basic` as the first, introducing multi-agent concepts and the ease of creating a swarm of simple AIs.

## Folder: crew_ai_basic

This folder demonstrates a basic multi-agent system using the CrewAI framework, where three agents—Content Planner, Content Writer, and Editor—collaborate to create a blog post on "Artificial Intelligence." It highlights the simplicity of agent-based systems compared to a single complex AI.

### Contents

- **`multi_agent.ipynb`**: Google Colab notebook implementing the multi-agent system with Google's Gemini model.
- **`walkthrough.txt`**: Documentation explaining the code and offering student guidance for experimentation.

### Purpose

- Introduce multi-agent collaboration
- Show ease of creating specialized agents
- Encourage customization and learning
- Highlight workflow transparency

## Getting Started

1. Open `multi_agent.ipynb` in Google Colab
2. Replace `"YOUR_KEY_HERE"` with your Gemini API key
3. Run the notebook
4. Refer to `walkthrough.txt` for code details and experiment ideas

## Future Folders

Additional folders will explore advanced multi-agent systems, building on `crew_ai_basic`.
